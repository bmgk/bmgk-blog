# Introduction

I was working in factories and many times I had to create logic for the merging point with different types.
Of course, the most important thing was cycle time and the correct sequence of upcoming types.
There are many ways how to make it. Depending on the size of the queue we can use a FIFO, but sometimes we want to have some "smaller" solution.
I would like to show how to make scalable logic for it.

# Part flow

I use the Vass5 line as an example, but I will try a present a universal pattern of logic for it.

Our (master) branch which dictated produced type is the way with red circles.
With part stops (robot or station) P1..4.
The addition way (slave) is green circles P1..2.
The merging point is a blue circle.
P1 is a conveyor with two types of parts.
P1 is two rack towers, BH1 with parts for the first type and BH2 for the second type.

Our master way has 4 elements in length. Slaves only 2 elements. We would like to have a universal pattern for it.
So we assign variables like M(master) = 4 and S(Slave) = 2

The merging point is a turn table with two stations each for another type. 425210WZ = 1, 425210V02 = 2.
Where first part is from the slave side P2 and the second from master P4.

# Logic concept

### Robot 425165R01 P2

In the beginning, we need to introduce variables for each "part stop element" with information about the current handled type.
We need to avoid the situation overproducing of parts on the "slave" side.
Try to imagine a situation where the part will be detected by sensors on the station and robot during picking at the same time.
We need to separate it in a proper way, so the good option will be to use some signal which informs us that the robot is not in the station workspace.
PF signal(A75_PF1V2) will be used in the example (Robot out of workspace). Each type has a separate robot program (1 and 71 for type 2).
For minimization cycle time, we detect part on the robot when he starts the program and he doesn't drop part on the next station (FM3 - status drop part finished).

### Station 425170 P3

We have a separation between 425165R01 and 425170 by using a signal robot out of the workspace, so we don't have to use the separation signal again in station logic.
It will be better for cycle time also because we will have information about parts on the station immediately after a drop (not after leaving the workspace by a robot).

### Robot 425175R01 P4

Using the fact that the "slave" side drops part first on station 425210.
We could have a situation, where Robot 425175R01 waits with a part on the gripper.
An important is to introduce variables with information that the robot has a part on the gripper.
It is similar to the previous one, but we need to separate here again station 425170 and robot by robot out of workspace signal.

### Robot 425195R01 P2

This is the first "slave" element. We will order robots to execute specified program numbers based on merging point requirements.
On the muster side, we protect the line against detecting too many parts by separation.
On the slave side, we have to avoid disappear of parts, because this will overproduce parts on the slave side.
So we will use signals like PartIsNotOnX. Where '/' mean negation of part on the specified element.

In our sample "slave" way is too short to present the usage of signal PartIsNotOn, but it will be used in general pattern MxN
We should prepare the "PartIsNotOnX" signal for each element in a "slave" way except first (because the robot is not able to be in two places at the same time)

## Order part type logic

In our logic pattern, we will always control the first robot in a slave way.
It doesn't matter how many elements this way contains. This logic below is the same as for type 2.
There are only different signals.

This is our calculate matrix. We start from the first case which means, that at least one part must be on the master's side if the slave side is empty.
We use for this on "slave" side signal "PartIsNotOnStation".
In this case, is enough to use a marker with information that the station for type 1 is free.
In the general case, we should have S-1 logic elements there. We make -1 because the first robot cannot execute two actions at the same time.
The merging point process starts from slave then we calculate this also like the "slave" way element.
At the start will be the "and" logic of S-1 "PartIsNotOnX" signals(the whole slave way is empty).
This "or" logic in the first branch there is one or more elements on the master way.

The second branch means that if one element is on the "slave" side the "master" way must have, at least 2 parts.
We should start from the logic "One element is on slave way" and next to OR of all combination "slave" signals "PartIsOnX" that we have 2 parts on the "master" side.

We could create more branches depending on the count of salve/master elements.
This matrix logic must be in shortcut relation, that count of slave parts < count of master parts.

There is also an alternative way of making it. Which is very useful when M and S are bigger.
By comparing variables which will contain the current sum of all "partIsOnX" on Slave and Master way.
But there is important that in each cycle summation must start from 0 to avoid for example taking part by workers from inside the line.
